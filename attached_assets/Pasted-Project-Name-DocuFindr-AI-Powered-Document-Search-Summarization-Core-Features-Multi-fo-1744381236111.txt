Project Name: DocuFindr (AI-Powered Document Search & Summarization)
Core Features:

    Multi-format Document Upload (PDF, DOCX, TXT, PPTX).

    NLP-Powered Semantic Search (finds documents even with nearby-meaning keywords).

    AI Summarization (condenses documents into key points).

    Simple User Profile (no auth, just mock username display).

UI/UX Requirements
1. Main Page Layout

    Header:

        App Name: "DocuFindr" (bold, modern typography).

        User Profile (top-right):

            Placeholder: "Guest User" + generic avatar icon (no login logic).

2. Sidebar Navigation

    üìÅ Upload Doc ‚Äì Button to upload files (drag-and-drop or file picker).

    üîç Search Doc ‚Äì NLP-powered search interface.

    üìù Summarize Doc ‚Äì Summarization panel.

3. Functional Screens

A. Document Upload Screen

    Supports: PDF, DOCX, TXT, PPTX.

    Displays uploaded files in a list with metadata (filename, date, size).

    Error handling for unsupported formats.

B. NLP Search Screen

    Search bar with:

        Semantic Search Toggle (default: ON) ‚Äì Uses NLP to match:

            Synonyms (e.g., "car" ‚Üí "vehicle").

            Related concepts (e.g., "climate" ‚Üí "weather").

        Filters (date, file type).

    Results ranked by relevance score (highlighting matched keywords).

C. Summarization Screen

    File upload zone + dropdown to select from previously uploaded docs.

    Output: Bullet-point summary + key themes (mock OpenAI-style output).

Technical Requirements
Frontend

    Framework: React.js (with hooks for state management).

    UI Library: Material-UI or TailwindCSS.

    File Handling: Use react-dropzone for uploads.

Mock NLP Search Logic (if no backend yet):

    Pretend-search using:

        A keyword expansion list (e.g., "happy" ‚Üí ["joyful", "content"]).

        Mock "relevance" scores based on term frequency.

Future-Proofing

    Assume Firebase Integration Later:

        Firestore for document metadata.

        Firebase Storage for file uploads.

        Cloud Functions for NLP/Summarization (e.g., calling OpenAI API).

Example User Flow

    User uploads a PDF (report.pdf).

    Searches for "financial growth" ‚Üí Also returns docs with:

        "Revenue increase" (synonym).

        "Economic expansion" (related concept).

    Clicks "Summarize" on a doc ‚Üí Gets a 3-sentence AI summary.

Styling Notes

    Themes: Professional (blues/darks with clean whitespace).

    Micro-interactions: Loading spinners during uploads/searches.
